# Interpretable Machine Learning Assignments  

This repo contains my coursework and projects for Interpretable ML. Each assignment has its own folder with a notebook, report, and README.  

**Assignment 2** â€” *Customer Churn Prediction*: Compared OLS, logistic regression (with LASSO feature selection), and GAMs on the Telco dataset. Focused on both predictive performance and interpretability.  

*(More assignments will be added here as I complete them.)*
