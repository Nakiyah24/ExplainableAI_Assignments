# Interpretable Machine Learning Assignments  

This repo contains my coursework and projects for Interpretable ML. Each assignment has its own folder with a notebook, report, and README.  

**Assignment 2** — *Customer Churn Prediction*: Compared OLS, logistic regression (with LASSO feature selection), and GAMs on the Telco dataset. Focused on both predictive performance and interpretability.  

**Assignment 3** — *Machine Learning Court (Loan Case)*: Acted as the prosecution to challenge the fairness of a loan approval model using LIME and Anchors. Showed how the model relied on weak or biased signals while undervaluing key financial indicators.  

**Assignment 4** — *Student Performance Prediction*: Trained a Random Forest on student grade data and explored model interpretability using PDP, ICE, and ALE. Focused on the features `absences` and `studytime`, showing how combinations of the two influence predicted grades. PDP gave global averages, ICE revealed heterogeneous effects, and ALE highlighted local patterns without extrapolating into sparse regions.  

**Assignment 5** — *Explainable Deep Learning*: Used a pretrained ResNet-50 model to classify Himalayan bird species and applied Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Score-CAM to visualize model attention. Compared how each method highlighted different regions of the images and reflected on when the model focused on relevant versus misleading cues. The task emphasized explainability’s role in wildlife conservation by revealing how deep models perceive species and what features drive their predictions.
