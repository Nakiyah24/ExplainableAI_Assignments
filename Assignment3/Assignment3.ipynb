        "For Jane’s case, the model predicted a 69.7% probability of her earning less than (or equal to) 50K and only a 30.3% chance of greater than 50K - resulting in her loan denial.\n",
        "\n",
        "The LIME model shows that the strongest factor pushing her toward denial was reporting no capital gains, followed by smaller effects from no capital losses, her never-married status, and not-in-family relationship status. Even demographic features like sex and race contributed slightly toward denial. Meanwhile, her positive factors such as her long work hours, bachelor’s degree, and executive occupation pushed her toward approval, but not enough to outweigh the negatives. This strongly shows that the model is placing disproportionate weight on weaker or irrelevant signals rather than key indicators of earning power.\n",
        "\n",
        "Anchor further reinforces this problem. The rule revelas that if an applicant’s relationship is “not-in-family” and their marital status is “never-married,” the model almost always predicts they earn less than (or equal to) 50K, with a precision of about 95.3%. This reduces Jane’s profile to demographic attributes and ignores her real qualifications ike her education and occupation.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The overall problem that LIME and Anchor both highlight is that Jane’s denial is being driven by demographic and social status factors, while her positive (that are more financial oriented) attributes — such as her executive occupation, education, and long work hours — are overlooked. This highlights how the model makes unfair biases, reducing her profile to a couple of categorical conditions rather than evaluating her full qualifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the problem does not end there. Even if we were to assume that the model made a decision fairly and accurately - taking into account important variables like education and occupation over the non-financial status - the model is incorrect to begin with. This is because of the error that was present in the preprocessing stage where it classified the target 'class' variable as a categorical variable and encoded that column. This collapsed the target values and caused the model to see the outcome labels incorrectly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Simply put, the model was not just biased in its reasoning - it was trained on a corrupted target variable from the beginning. Thus, any decision it made, including Jane's denial (the first time) were built on the wrong ground truth. This makes the model not only unfair but also unreliable at a fundamental level, and had we not made more post-modeling checks or done more analysis, we would have trusted a model that never actually learned the true distinction between applicants earning greater than 50K and those earning less than (or equal to) 50K."

        "- LIME shows the decision rests primarily on no capital gains/losses and family status;\n",

        "\n",
        "Neither rationale reflects ability-to-repay. The inclusion and influence of sex/race/familial relationships further violates fair-lending norms. This decision, and the model behind it, fail the standard of a fair credit decision.\n",
